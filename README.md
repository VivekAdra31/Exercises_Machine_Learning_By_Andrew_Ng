# Machine_Learning_Exercises
Exercises in the course-Machine Learning by Andrew Ng offered by Stanford University on Coursera.
These Exercises are in GNU-Octave and contain optimized Vectorized implementations of various Machine Learning Algorithms

The course covered theoretical and mathematical background and then implementation of the algorithms on GNU-Octave.Andrew Ng discusses and gives lots of Real-Life advice for applying Machine Learning.
